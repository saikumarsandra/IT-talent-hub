Javascript 

- high level object oriented programming language 
- used in frontend and backend 
- can be used along with HTML, CSS 
- server side -> node js  ( backend)
- modern javascript libraries / framework -> react js , angular js, vue js ( front end)

Differnt versions of javascript 

ES5 -> ES6 / ES 2015 -> ES7 / ES 2016  

 ECMA Script ->  standard 


 Different ways of writing javascript code 

3 ways

- inline
- internal 
- external 


comments

- comments will be ignored 
- prevent some code execution


- single line
- multi line 


variables 

- used to store values
- different data can be store using variables

Rules 

- variable name should contain only letters/ numbers /underscore / dollar 
- cannot start with numbers
- can start with underscore / dollar 
- cannot use keywords as variable name

keywords -> predefined / reserved words 

var, let, const are the keywords to declare variables 

var -> variable declared with var keyword belongs to window object
let -> variable declared with let keyword does not belongs to window object


const -> value of variable declared with const keyword cannot be changed 


Data types 

-> data types are used to store different types of values relsted to types of data 

primitive data types

- number 
   -> used for decimals and integers 
   -> all numbers are floating point numbers in js
   -> 21 -> 21.0
   
- string
   -> used for text
   -> sequence of characters

- boolean
    -> logical type -> store only true / false
    -> take decisions 
   
- undefined

-> varibale whose value is not defined 
-> can be called as empty value



- null 

-> also used to store empty value


- symbol(ES2015) -> value that is unique and cannot be changed
- big int (ES2020) -> larger integers than the number type can store 



dynamic typing -> no need to manually define the data type of value stored in variables, automatically data types will be determined

Operators 
Operator precedence


if statement
ternary operator
switch statement
prompt
== and ===
for loop,while, do while


Operators 

-> usage -> transorm / combine multiple values 

- arithmetic Operators
- assignment Operators
- increment / decrement Operators
- comparision Operators
- logical Operators

for  - when the number of iterations are fixed 

while - when the number of iterations are not fixed 

while vs do while 

if condition becomes false -> do while executes atleast once

if condition becomes false -> while loop does not gets executed
